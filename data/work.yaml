      Chico High School is a high school located in Chico, CA with a approximately 2,000 students and 87 teachers.

      ### Problem
      - **Manual Scheduling Limitations**: The existing method for building the master schedule was a manual process that typically took 3 months to complete and involved numerous variables, making it challenging to manage manually.
      - **Conflict Ratio**: Manual allocation achieved an 85% conflict-free rate, meaning 15% of students couldn't enroll in preferred classes.
      - **Resource Constraints**: Difficulty balancing teacher schedules and classroom utilization efficiently.

      ### Objective
      Develop an automated scheduling solution to streamline class allocation and minimize student conflicts.

      ### Action
      - Created a custom Registrar LLM agent to analyze scheduling constraints and student preferences.
      - Implemented Gurobi Optimization model running on AWS high-performance instances.
      - Developed an Excel output to visualize the schedule and allow for easy adjustments.
      - Successfully scaled the solution to handle the full student body of 1,600 students.

      ### Outcome
      - Improved conflict free scheduling ~11% while reducing process time from 3 months to hours.
      - Created a reusable, automated framework that optimizes teacher and classroom resource allocation.
