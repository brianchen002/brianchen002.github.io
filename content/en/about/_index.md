title: About Me

## Data Analyst & Business Intelligence Specialist

MS in Information Systems student at the University of Washington specializing in data analytics and optimization. I develop practical tech solutions for real-world problems, including an automated high school scheduling system using mixed integer linear programming that improved the educational experience for 1,600+ students. My portfolio showcases my commitment to accessible, data-driven solutions that make meaningful impact.

Outside of work, I enjoy running, backpacking, and skiing. My international perspective was shaped by growing up with 14 exchange students and participating in a wine marketing program in Siena, Italy, where I collaborated with Castello di Volpaia Winery.
